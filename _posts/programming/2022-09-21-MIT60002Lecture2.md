# 1. The Pros and Cons of Greedy
 A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available 
at the moment. This algorithm is **easy to implement** and **computationally efficient**.
But, **does not always yield the best solution and don't even know how good the approximation is.**



# 2. Brute Force Algorithm
 This algorithm outputs only the correct answer with 100%. Because it **enumerate all possible 
combinations of items**. Then, remove all of the combinations whose total units exceeds the allowed
weight. From the remaining combinations choose any one whose value is the largest.

# 3 .Search Tree Implemention

 Tree used to locate specific keys within a set. The tree is built top down starting with the root.
The first element is selected from the stil to be considered items. A node of tree is constructed
that reflects the consequence of choosing to take or not that item. If we choose the item,
we draw this consequence as the left child, otherwise, the right child.   
 This process is then applied recursively to non-leaf children. Finally, chose a node with the
 highest value that meets constraints.
 
# 4. Computational Complexity
 **Time based on number of nodes generated**.
